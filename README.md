# Dependency-Updater
A simple Crystal script (mostly a learning exercise) to scan a given base directory
for Maven/Gradle build files and perform various update options.

# TODO
- Parse files for dependency keywords and values
- Connect to appropriate central repositories to compare versions
- Give optional flags to attempt to update/rebuild/test projects with latest major/minor/bug versions
